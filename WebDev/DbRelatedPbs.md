# ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Questions for Local-First Hybrid Task Management Application

This document outlines every essential question that needs to be addressed throughout the lifecycle of building a hybrid task and project management application with local-only database storage, GPT integration, and no server dependency.

## ðŸ“Œ A. Database Selection Stage

1. **Database Technology Decision**

   * Should I use SQLite, IndexedDB, Realm, WatermelonDB, or Ionic Storage?
   * Which option performs better on low-end devices?
   * Can the selected database support complex relational queries?
   * How well does it handle large volumes of nested objects (Goals â†’ Tasks â†’ Timesheets)?
   * Does it provide encryption or do I need to build it separately?
   * How portable is the DB format across Android/iOS?
   * What are the offline-read/write speeds for 10k+ records?
   * Is there an active Capacitor plugin for this DB thatâ€™s well maintained?

2. **Compatibility**

   * Will it work smoothly with Capacitor on both iOS and Android?
   * Does it support both synchronous and asynchronous operations?
   * Does it support background operations (like scheduled goal checks)?
   * Will it be compatible with the future backend (if I sync later)?
   * What happens if the app is uninstalledâ€”how is data backup handled?

3. **Security & Compliance**

   * How will I store sensitive data (like OpenAI keys or task logs) securely?
   * Does the DB have built-in support for secure local storage?
   * Do I need to encrypt fields or full DB at rest?
   * Is this secure enough for storing user performance and goal tracking data?
   * How do I prevent reverse engineering of the DB?

## ðŸ“Œ B. Data Model Design & Implementation

4. **Schema Strategy**

   * Should I normalize or denormalize the schema?
   * How do I model one-to-many (Goals â†’ Tasks) and many-to-many (Tasks â†” Projects)?
   * How to handle schema versioning and migrations locally?
   * Whatâ€™s the best way to structure recurring task patterns?
   * How should I index goals/tasks to ensure fast querying?

5. **Storage Optimization**

   * Should I compress or split large JSON blobs?
   * Will timesheet/task logs lead to DB bloat over time?
   * How to track completed vs. pending goals efficiently?
   * Should I log full history of task edits?

6. **Data Lifecycle**

   * Whatâ€™s the data retention policy? Do I auto-delete old logs?
   * Can users export/import their data?
   * What data gets preserved when app is cleared or reinstalled?

## ðŸ“Œ C. AI Integration Considerations

7. **GPT Prompt Engineering**

   * Where should prompt logic resideâ€”locally in app or as static config?
   * How do I pre-process and reduce task data to stay within GPT token limits?
   * How to securely send task data without compromising privacy?
   * Can I cache AI responses locally to avoid repeated API calls?
   * How do I test prompt accuracy without real-time backend logging?

8. **OpenAI Key Handling**

   * How do I validate and securely store the API key locally?
   * What happens if the key is expired or incorrectâ€”do I retry, notify, fallback?
   * How do I display usage errors gracefully to users?
   * Can I warn the user before high-cost API usage scenarios?

## ðŸ“Œ D. Application Functionality Development

9. **To-Do List Management**

   * How do I link tasks to goals and projects with minimal latency?
   * Can I sort/filter/prioritize tasks efficiently without re-render bottlenecks?
   * How do I design drag-and-drop that syncs with DB changes instantly?

10. **Goal Breakdown Logic**

* How do I automatically convert yearly â†’ monthly â†’ weekly â†’ daily goals?
* Can I allow the user to override this automation?
* What if a goal starts mid-monthâ€”how is that handled?

11. **Streaks & Gamification**

* How do I calculate and store daily streaks locally?
* How are badges and rewards awarded without server verification?
* Can I prevent users from gaming the system by editing completed tasks?

12. **Reporting**

* Where do I store generated reports?
* Should reports be cached or computed dynamically each time?
* How do I support PDF export from a local-only setup?

13. **Notifications**

* How are reminders scheduled with Capacitorâ€™s local notifications?
* What happens if the user kills the appâ€”are notifications persistent?
* How do I prevent notification spam for repetitive goals?

## ðŸ“Œ E. Testing & Quality Assurance

14. **Functional Testing**

* How do I simulate multi-profile use cases locally?
* Can I test DB migrations without data loss?
* How do I validate AI outputs under diverse user goals?

15. **Performance Testing**

* How does the DB behave with 100+ projects, 10,000+ tasks?
* Is performance acceptable on older Android/iOS phones?
* How long does initial DB population and retrieval take?

16. **Security Testing**

* How do I confirm that no sensitive data is leaking?
* Can I simulate attempts to reverse engineer stored data?

---

## ðŸ“Œ F. Backup & Recovery

17. **Data Portability**

* Can I allow the user to back up the DB as a file (e.g., .json)?
* How do I allow them to import data and resolve merge conflicts?
* What file format ensures cross-device compatibility?

18. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**

* What if a local DB becomes corruptedâ€”can I reset it?
* Should I have a "safe mode" boot with minimal data load?

---

## ðŸ“Œ G. Deployment & Distribution

19. **Packaging**

* Is the bundled SQLite or storage plugin production-grade?
* Does the app size remain lightweight?
* Does it pass Google Play Store/Apple App Store security checks?

20. **Updates**

* How do I handle DB schema migrations post-deployment?
* Can I push silent updates to patch local logic?

21. **Testing Across Devices**

* Do I support both Android 8+ and iOS 13+?
* Are push notifications and DB operations tested on real hardware?

---

## ðŸ“Œ H. End-User Experience Post Launch

22. **Usability**

* Are loading times minimal even with thousands of records?
* Is there visual feedback for data-saving operations?
* Do users understand how goal breakdowns and AI suggestions work?

23. **Reliability**

* What happens if user clears app storage?
* How do I reassure users their data is safe and recoverable?

24. **Supportability**

* Is there an in-app help section for issues with AI, tasks, goals?
* Can I debug user issues without server logs?

25. **Scalability (Offline-First)**

* Can I scale to team-level usage in future with minimal redesign?
* Can local user profiles simulate real user separation effectively?
