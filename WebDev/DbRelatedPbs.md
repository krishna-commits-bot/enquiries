   * Will it work smoothly with Capacitor on both iOS and Android?
   * Does it support both synchronous and asynchronous operations?
   * Does it support background operations (like scheduled goal checks)?
   * Will it be compatible with the future backend (if I sync later)?
   * What happens if the app is uninstalled—how is data backup handled?

3. **Security & Compliance**
