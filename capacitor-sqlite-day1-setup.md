# Day 1 ‚Äì Setup SQLite Database with Capacitor

## Goals:
- Setup local SQLite database using Capacitor
- Define the initial database schema
- Insert mock data for testing purposes

---

## üß± SQLite + Capacitor Setup

Capacitor is a cross-platform native runtime by Ionic. It allows us to use native functionality in web-based mobile apps. For storing structured data, Capacitor supports SQLite through plugins.

### Why SQLite?

- Lightweight and fast
- Works well for mobile applications
- Easy to integrate with Capacitor using `@capacitor-community/sqlite`

## üóÇÔ∏è Initial Schema Definition

Here is an example schema to track job applications (used in job tracking apps):

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_applications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    company_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    job_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'Applied', 'Interviewing', 'Offer', 'Rejected'
    application_date TEXT,
    notes TEXT
);
```

---

## üîÑ Insert Mock Data

We insert a few records to test our queries and structure:

```sql
INSERT INTO job_applications (company_name, job_title, status, application_date, notes)
VALUES ('OpenAI', 'Software Engineer', 'Applied', '2025-05-21', 'Excited about the role.');

INSERT INTO job_applications (company_name, job_title, status, application_date, notes)
VALUES ('Google', 'Backend Developer', 'Interviewing', '2025-05-10', 'Technical round scheduled.');

INSERT INTO job_applications (company_name, job_title, status, application_date, notes)
VALUES ('Meta', 'Frontend Engineer', 'Rejected', '2025-04-29', 'Rejection email received.');
```

## ‚ùì Developer Questions & Detailed Answers (50 Questions)

### 1. How does Capacitor handle native SQLite operations under the hood?

Capacitor uses a bridge to communicate with native code. SQLite operations are executed using native Android/iOS SQLite libraries via `@capacitor-community/sqlite`, which exposes JS methods that call platform-specific implementations.

### 2. Is data persisted across app restarts?

Yes, data stored using SQLite is persisted in the app‚Äôs sandboxed storage unless explicitly deleted.

### 3. How does performance compare with alternatives like IndexedDB or Realm?

SQLite is generally faster for structured relational data and large datasets. IndexedDB suits browser use, while Realm may offer better sync features but adds more overhead.

### 4. Can the database be backed up or exported?

Yes, using plugin APIs or native file system access, you can export the `.db` file for backup or migration.

### 5. How to reset or wipe the local SQLite DB?

You can drop tables, delete the DB file, or reinitialize the database via plugin methods.

### 6. What happens if schema changes are introduced?

Without migrations, changes can lead to crashes. Use schema versioning and migration scripts to handle schema changes.

### 7. How to version the database schema?

Maintain a version field and execute version-specific upgrade logic when initializing the DB.

### 8. Is there support for relational integrity (foreign keys)?

Yes, SQLite supports foreign keys, but they must be explicitly enabled using `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`

### 9. How secure is the local SQLite data?

SQLite is not encrypted by default. Use SQLCipher for encrypted storage if security is a concern.

### 10. Can SQLite handle concurrent reads/writes in a mobile app?

SQLite supports concurrency but is limited by write-locking. Use transactions carefully and avoid long-running queries.

### 11. How to test SQL queries locally without running the full app?

Use DB tools (like DB Browser for SQLite) or run in a Node.js test environment with mock data.

### 12. What is the best practice to separate read and write queries?

Use service-layer separation and transaction management. Group reads and writes to avoid conflicts.

### 13. Can mock data be reloaded/reset dynamically during development?

Yes, through scripts that drop and re-seed tables with sample data.

### 14. How large can the SQLite DB grow in a typical mobile environment?

It can handle gigabytes of data, but performance degrades beyond a few hundred MBs without indexing.

### 15. Does SQLite support JSON or unstructured data types?

Yes, via JSON1 extension, allowing storage and querying of JSON data.

### 16. What indexing strategies are supported?

B-tree indexing by default. Support for single, compound, and partial indexes.

### 17. How do we ensure ACID compliance with Capacitor‚Äôs plugin?

SQLite is ACID-compliant by design. Use transactions correctly via plugin methods.

### 18. What are the limitations of @capacitor-community/sqlite?

Not as mature as native implementations. Some advanced SQLite features may be unsupported.

### 19. Are there any tools for inspecting the SQLite DB on a real device?

Use Android Studio Device File Explorer or Xcode. You can also export the DB and inspect it with DB tools.

### 20. How to sync SQLite DB with remote APIs?

Use background sync jobs, REST APIs, and local change-tracking logic.

### 21. What is the best way to store binary data (e.g., images) in SQLite?

Store file paths in the DB, not binary blobs. This reduces DB bloat.

### 22. Are transactions supported natively in the plugin?

Yes, the plugin exposes transaction methods for batch inserts/updates.

### 23. How to handle rollback in case of failures?

Use transaction blocks. If any query fails, call rollback().

### 24. How to fetch large datasets without performance hits?

Use pagination and limit queries. Load only necessary fields.

### 25. Can SQLite queries be parameterized?

Yes, prepared statements can be used via plugin methods to avoid SQL injection.

### 26. What are the best practices for structuring multiple tables?

Normalize where necessary, use clear naming, index foreign keys, and design for extensibility.

### 27. How to handle nullable fields in SQLite schema?

Define fields without NOT NULL, and use NULL values explicitly.

### 28. How to integrate foreign keys and cascading deletes?

Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` and enable foreign key support using PRAGMA.

### 29. Is full-text search supported in SQLite?

Yes, using FTS5 extension, which allows full-text indexing and querying.

### 30. How to migrate user data between app versions?

Version control your schema and apply migrations conditionally during app start.

### 31. Is there a limit to the number of rows or tables?

SQLite supports millions of rows and thousands of tables, but performance depends on hardware.

### 32. How to manage SQLite DB across different platforms (iOS/Android)?

Use Capacitor plugins for platform-specific behavior. Maintain a shared schema and test both builds.

### 33. How to handle data conflicts during sync or updates?

Use conflict resolution policies (last-write wins, merge logic, or manual review).

### 34. Can we define triggers inside SQLite using Capacitor?

Yes, SQLite supports triggers; define them in schema migration scripts.

### 35. How to encrypt sensitive data in the database?

Use SQLCipher or encrypt at the application level before storing.

### 36. How does the performance degrade with 100k+ rows?

Without indexing, query time increases. Use indexes and optimize queries.

### 37. Can we run complex JOIN queries effectively?

Yes, SQLite handles joins well if indexes are defined properly.

### 38. What are common pitfalls in using SQLite in mobile apps?

Schema changes without migration, write-locks, DB corruption on crashes.

### 39. How to implement pagination for large result sets?

Use LIMIT and OFFSET in queries. Cache or lazy-load results.

### 40. How to debug SQLite issues on real devices?

Export the DB file, enable debug logs in app, use native tools for inspection.

### 41. How do different mobile OS versions affect SQLite behavior?

SQLite is bundled with the app, so behavior is mostly consistent unless plugin API changes.

### 42. Can SQLite database be bundled with the app initially?

Yes, pre-populate and copy DB file on first app launch.

### 43. What happens on app uninstall and reinstall?

All local data, including SQLite, is deleted unless backed up externally.

### 44. How to ensure cross-platform data consistency?

Use shared schema, rigorous testing, and common data validation logic.

### 45. Is lazy loading of data possible with SQLite?

Yes, by using paginated queries or loading chunks of data on demand.

### 46. How does SQLite behave in offline mode with sync capability?

Works offline; sync logic must track local changes and push to server when online.

### 47. What plugin APIs are exposed for backup/restore?

Capacitor plugin provides export/import and filesystem access to handle DB backup/restore.

### 48. Can a corrupted DB be detected and repaired automatically?

Detection is manual, repair is limited. Maintain backups and implement integrity checks.

### 49. How often should we vacuum or optimize the DB?

Periodically after many deletes. Use VACUUM to rebuild and optimize the DB.

### 50. What are best practices for writing safe and efficient SQL in mobile apps?

Use parameterized queries, proper indexing, normalized schema, and regular profiling.
