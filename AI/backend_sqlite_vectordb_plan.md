# Backend Project Plan: SQLite & VectorDB (4-Day Task List)

## Overview

This project involves two separate backend modules:
- **SQLite** (handled by Raj)
- **Vector Database for Search Embeddings** (handled by Colleague)

Both components are to be built from scratch, with full documentation of questions, challenges, issues, and benefits. This document outlines a structured 4-day task list for each.

- Document:
  - What is SQLite?
  - When and why to use SQLite?
  - Advantages & disadvantages.
  - FAQs: concurrency, file-based DBs, locking, performance, security.

### Day 2 ‚Äì Schema Design & Queries
- Design normalized schema.
- Implement constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`.
- Use indexes to improve performance.
- Execute JOINs, aggregate queries, subqueries.
- Document:
  - Schema decisions.
  - Query performance.
  - Index impact.
  - Transactions & locks.

### Day 3 ‚Äì Advanced Topics & Integration
- Use transactions: `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
- Simulate concurrency scenarios.
- Explore Full-Text Search (FTS).
- Try integrating with a Node.js/Python script.
- Document:
  - Concurrency limitations.
  - FTS use cases.
  - Integration steps and challenges.

### Day 4 ‚Äì Use Case Demo & Summary
- Create a CLI app using SQLite.
- Stress-test with 100k+ rows.
- Document:
  - Final schema design.
  - Q&A (~50 developer questions).
  - Performance metrics.
  - Backups, limitations, lessons learned.
