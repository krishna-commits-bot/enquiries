# 📱 Local Database Options for ReactJS Hybrid Mobile Apps (Serverless)

Welcome, dev! If you're building a **serverless hybrid mobile app** using **ReactJS**, choosing the right **local database** is crucial. This doc breaks down the top DB choices with **specific use cases**, **pros/cons**, and **why** you'd pick each over others.

---

## 🔍 Core Requirements

- 📦 **Local storage only** (serverless)
- 💻 **Hybrid mobile app** (ReactJS + Capacitor/Cordova)
- ♻️ **Persistent** across sessions
- 📊 Can handle structured or unstructured data

---

## ✅ Top DB Options for Your Use Case

### 1. **SQLite** *(Relational SQL DB via Capacitor Plugin)*

**📌 Best for:** Structured data, multiple related tables, SQL-like querying.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Relational model with ACID compliance.
- Can run complex queries with joins, filters, etc.
- Used by enterprise-level apps (offline-first CRMs, inventory managers).

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- IndexedDB/LocalStorage don't support relations or real SQL queries.
- PouchDB/RxDB are document-based (NoSQL), which can make structured data harder to query.

**✅ Pros:**
- Fast and reliable
- Wide community support
- Plugin-based support in Capacitor/Cordova

**⚠️ Cons:**
- Requires native plugin (initial setup needed)
- Not browser-compatible out-of-the-box

---

### 2. **IndexedDB** *(Native browser-based NoSQL store)*

**📌 Best for:** Progressive Web Apps or light, browser-based hybrid apps.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Built into every modern browser.
- No plugin required – easy PWA compatibility.

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- SQLite is not browser-native.
- IndexedDB is better for storing large unstructured data than LocalStorage.

**✅ Pros:**
- High capacity
- Asynchronous and event-driven
- Works in WebView without native plugin

**⚠️ Cons:**
- API is verbose and hard to use directly
- Poor developer ergonomics compared to SQLite or LocalStorage

---

### 3. **LocalStorage** *(Wrapper over IndexedDB/WebSQL/LocalStorage)*

**📌 Best for:** Quick and simple key-value or object storage with fallback support.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Simplifies the storage process with a consistent API.
- Fallbacks ensure broader support (older Android devices, etc.).

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- Easier to use than IndexedDB directly.
- Better browser fallback than SQLite.

**✅ Pros:**
- Simple API: `.getItem`, `.setItem`, etc.
- Fallbacks: IndexedDB > WebSQL > LocalStorage
- No native plugins required

**⚠️ Cons:**
- No querying support
- Not suitable for relational or large-scale structured data

---

### 4. **PouchDB** *(NoSQL JSON Document DB)*

**📌 Best for:** Offline-first apps with flexible schema needs.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Stores data as documents (like MongoDB).
- Can optionally sync with CouchDB in the future.

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- IndexedDB and LocalStorage lack document-level querying.
- SQLite is overkill for flat or unstructured data.

**✅ Pros:**
- Easy to use JSON document storage
- Good for offline-first experiences
- Decent querying support for NoSQL

**⚠️ Cons:**
- Bulkier than LocalStorage
- Not ideal for structured relational data

---

### 5. **RxDB** *(Reactive NoSQL DB built on IndexedDB / PouchDB)*

**📌 Best for:** Real-time reactive UI data binding with local DB.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Real-time UI reactivity: perfect for apps with frequently changing local data.
- Has schema validation and reactive querying.

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- IndexedDB/LocalStorage don’t support reactive queries.
- SQLite doesn’t fit reactive paradigm easily.

**✅ Pros:**
- Reactive data (works great with React hooks/state)
- Encrypted storage available
- Supports syncing, though optional

**⚠️ Cons:**
- Heavier dependency
- Steeper learning curve

---

### 🎯 Bonus: **WatermelonDB** *(Lazy-loaded SQLite with React focus)*

**📌 Best for:** Large datasets with high performance and reactivity in React Native/Hybrid apps.

**✨ Why Use It:**
- Based on SQLite, but with lazy loading and reactivity.

**🚫 Why Not Others:**
- RxDB is more flexible but heavier.
- PouchDB is not as performant with large lists.

**✅ Pros:**
- Blazing fast even with thousands of records
- Reactive queries

**⚠️ Cons:**
- Limited flexibility
- Setup is heavier; not browser-ready

## 🤔 So, Which One Should You Choose?

| Your Need                         | Best DB        |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Structured relational data       | **SQLite**     |
| Quick setup for simple storage   | **LocalStorage**|
| Large JSON documents             | **PouchDB**    |
| Reactive UI + NoSQL              | **RxDB**       |
| Maximum browser compatibility    | **IndexedDB**  |

---

## 📦 Suggested Stack Example (ReactJS + Capacitor)

```sh
npm install @capacitor-community/sqlite
```

Use SQLite like this:

```ts
import { CapacitorSQLite, SQLiteConnection } from '@capacitor-community/sqlite';
const sqlite = new SQLiteConnection(CapacitorSQLite);
// Connect, create table, insert, query
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- 🧪 **Start small**: Begin with LocalStorage or PouchDB during prototyping.

- 📈 **Future-proof**: Use SQLite if you might scale or introduce complex querying.

- 🌀 **UI-first apps**: Prefer RxDB if you rely heavily on UI state syncing with data.

- 🧩 **Go plugin-free**: Use IndexedDB or LocalStorage if you avoid native dependencies.

---

## 🔚 Final Word

Choosing the right local DB is a **design decision**. Think about:

- Data structure complexity

- Querying needs

- Reactivity/UI interaction

- Plugin availability
